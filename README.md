WooCommerce point of sale WordPress plugin.

## Description ##

### WooCommerce Point of Sales (POS) ###
wePOS is a fast and responsive( Tablets & Desktop ) WooCommerce Point of Sales plugin. It lets you take orders and track your inventory using your WooCommerce store. You can physically count your WooCommerce products by scanning Bar codes and add them directly to customerâ€™s cart for processing the order.

### Based of REST API ###
wePOS is a single page application that works super fast. We have used WooCommerce REST API and some custom API to develop the plugin. This has made the plugin to response fast and gets your work done in time. In a physical store, you get a lot of customers who wait to checkout their products. So, a fast system like wePoS can be your one-way ticket to manage your inventory easily.

### Attractive User Interface ###
A good UI can sometimes makes a system even more attractive. wePOS has an intuitive design that allows navigating easily. With it, you can manage your inventory and orders in an organized way.

### Shortcut / Hotkey Support ###
wePOS has shortcut key support that lets you use its features faster. This is very important for any physical store so that the sales executive can read the Barcodes and process the orders with pace.

### Privacy Policy ###
wePOS uses [Appsero](https://appsero.com) SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user's confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.

Appsero SDK **does not gather any data by default.** The SDK only starts gathering basic telemetry data **when a user allows it via the admin notice**. We collect the data to ensure great user experience for all our users.

Integrating Appsero SDK **DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY** start gathering data, **without confirmation from users in any case.**
